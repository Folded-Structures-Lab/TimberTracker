### Timber Consumption Tracker

With increasing competition for urban space and decreasing housing affordability, many local and State development plans are advocating a shift to higher-density residential development models. Higher density development allows for the more sustainable provision of infrastructure and public transport services. However, a shift from historical (detached housing) development models to a higher proportion of medium and high-density residential buildings will change the supply and performance demands of future construction materials. 

Timber is Australia's most common residential framing construction material, as well as the on carbon negative building material available in significant volumes. The Timber Consumption Tracker is a model is developed to estimate the volume of structural timber required to meet Australia's future dwelling construction projections, broken down into consumption by region and by detached, medium, and high-density dwelling types.  Assumptions used in model construction are documented on this page under the following stages:
1. Forecast Dwelling Construction (by Type and Locality)
2. Forecast Timber-Framed Dwellings
3. Forecast Timber Demand

Limitations and areas for future improvement are also noted under corresponding sections.
