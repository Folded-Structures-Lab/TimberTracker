### 2. Sawmill to Structural Timber
##### Structural Timber Production Volumes

The [National Wood Processing Survey](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/forests/forest-economics/national-wood-processing-survey) (Downham et al., 2019) reports the average sawmill product outputs relative to processed inputs:
- From Table 3: sawmill recovery rate = **47.8%** (total output volume / total input volume)
- From Table 5: structural product share = **51.7%** (dry structural product volume<sup>2a,2b</sup> / total output volume)

Combined, this gives an effective **structural recovery rate** of 47.8% x 51.7% = **24.7%**, adopted for all production years and regions<sup>2c, 2d</sup>.

##### Structural Grade Production Volumes
For future development (see also, [Consumption Data](/consumption/data) Note 2)..
<!-- 
The volume of structural timber used in any particular building is dependent on its structural grade. Structural grade recovery ratios (REF) could be applied for grade-specific categorisation of structural timber volumes. This is out-of-scope<sup>2e</sup> for the current website version, as it would be of greater utility once grade-specific market consumption data is available for comparison (see [Consumption Data](/consumption/data) Note 2).  -->

##### Engineered Wood Production Volumes
For future development (see also, [Consumption Data](/consumption/data) Note 2). 

<!-- 
Similar to the above point, a proportion of structural boards are further processed into laminated timber engineered wood products (EWPs). Some online data sources could be used for  product-specific categorisation of structural timber volumes. This is out-of-scope<sup>2f,2g</sup> for the current website version, as it would be of greater utiliy once product-specific market consumption data is available for comparison (see [Consumption Data](/consumption/data) Note 2).  -->


##### Notes for Improvement
- 2a: Ignores `green structural product' volume (2%). Unknown if used for residential building frame construction. 
- 2b: Ignores `dry appearance' (5.1%) and 'dry other' (17.9%) volumes. Used in building construction but as non-structural frame components.
- 2c: Assumes recovery rate and product share will be constant over time (unverified). Check against historical data and/or introdutimber product volumes
- 2d: Assumes the structural product share is the same for all sawmills- incorrect (varies by products produced, location, processed species). Update with mill-specific product shares or add additional sawmill categorisations with differences to product share.
<!-- - 2e: Add grade-specific recovery ratios. -->
<!-- - 2f: Add laminated timber EWP production volumes -->


### 3. Structural Timber to Building Construction

##### New Build Market Share
BIS Oxford Economics (2020) provides an estimate of sawn timber volumes used in specific downstream construction sectors<sup>3a</sup>. This includes estimation of volumes used in (1) new build construction (low, medium, and high density), (2) non-residential building construction, and (3) alterations and additions. Assuming that these sectors use all available strucutral timber, the proportion of structural sawn timber used in each sector is derived from listed in BIS Oxford Economics (2020) Table 1-3 as:

|5-Year Average | (1) | (2) | (3)|
|----|-----|-----|----|
|2021-25 | 55%	|14% |31%|	
|2026-30 |53%|	14% 33%|
|2031-35 |50% |16% 	|35%	|

This model assumes a **55% market new build share in 2024, decreasing by 0.5% pa to 2046**.

##### Wastage
Assumes 10% waste from sawnboard to final installation<sup>3b</sup>.  


##### Imported Product
For future development.



##### Notes for Improvement
- 3a: Various methods used to estimate market sector proportions consistently highlight its difficulty of evaluation. With higher-reliability building volume data (production and consumption), this could instead be compared/verified against alternate market share estimation measures e.g. from a mass flow balance. 
- 3b: Improve based on existing literature or fabricator data.
