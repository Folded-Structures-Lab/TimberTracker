### Timber Supply Tracker




Structural sawn timber, primarily sourced from softwood plantations, is the predominant framing material in residential housing construction. Owing to Australia's extensive history of timber use in construction, the supply chain for lightweight timber framing has evolved to be highly efficient. All production stages are supported domestically, with forestry and manufacturing networks strategically situated near most Australian urban development centers. The following video offers a brief overview of the timber production history in a `typical' Australian house.

The Timber Production Tracker is a material flow model capturing the Australian forest-to-building production capacity for structural timber products. Assumptions used in model construction are documented on this page under the following stages:
1. Forest to Sawmill
2. Sawmill to Structural Timber
3. Structural Timber to Building (New Residential Housing)

Limitations and areas for future improvement are also noted under corresponding sections. Please note that all volumes on this page refers to *softwood* timber, unless otherwise stated.
