## Development History


Despite the apparent proximity of their professions, collaboration between structural engineers and urban planners, whether in professional or research capacities, remains surprisingly scarce. 
A collaborative grant from the [John Monash Foundation Leadership Academy](https://www.johnmonash.com/the-leadership-academy/collaborative-grants) ("*Opportunities for Open Data Standards in Building and Urban Design*", 2023) allowed Joe Gattas (2010 JM Scholar) and Claire Daniel (2015 JM Scholar) to combine their respective expertise in computational building design in data-driven urban planning. The TimberTracker  website was first launched in March 2024 as the outcome of this project.

## Contributors
**Joe Gattas** is an Associate Professor in the UQ School of Civil Engineering and Co-Lead of Manufacturing and Value Chain Innovation research nodes of the ARC Advance Timber Hub. The overall Hub has been developed to accelerate innovation and the adoption of timber in Australian buildings; the above research Node includes projects dedicated to enhancing resource utilization throughout the forest-to-building timber value chain. Building on his prior research expertise in parametric modelling and computational building design, Joe’s Hub projects are focused on developing digital tools that: i) reduce the amount of plantation forest resources (specifically, the quantity of trees and plantation area) needed for timber construction, and ii) facilitate the integration of novel timber feedstocks and projects, thereby enhancing the consistency of timber supply.

**Claire Daniel** is an urban planner and spatial data scientist with broad professional experience in local government and consulting. Claire has recently completed their PhD at UNSW on digital disruption in urban planning, exploring the use of data and digital technology by professional planners. Claire is also a founding member of the Planning Institute of Australia’s national PlanTech working groups, formed to addressing the impacts of digital transformation on the way planning is undertaken. Claire is passionate about ensuring that digital planning systems are designed to improve public trust and achieve good outcomes for Australian communities and environments.
